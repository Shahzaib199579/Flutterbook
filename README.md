it has four tabs:
  1. Appointments: Add appointment on a calendar, edit appointment or slide to delete appointment.
  2. Contacts: Add contact, edit contact or slide to delete it.
  3. Notes: Add Notes, edit Notes or slide to delete it.
  4. Tasks: Add Tasks, edit Tasks, click on check box to complete it, slide to delete it.
